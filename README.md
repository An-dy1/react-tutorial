My notes:

- When writing in React, using JSX, a flavor of Javascript

  - Check out babeljs.io
  - Looks like HTML-JS mix

- Application is made up of components

  - how to make one?

  var Mystery = React.createClass({
  // here's where we make the component itself
  render: function () {
  return(<h3>Unsolved episodes of Unsolved Mysteries</h3>);
  }
  });

- Every component can only return one parent element

  - To include multiple HTML elements, nest in a div (one parent):

  var Mystery = React.createClass({
  // here's where we make the component itself
  render: function() {
  return (
  <div>
  <h3>Simple component one</h3>
  <p>Nested elements in one component</p>
  </div>
  );
  }
  });

- ReactDOM.render can only render one component; use div trick again if you want to repeat:

        ReactDOM.render(<div>
        <Mystery />
        <Mystery />
        <Mystery />
        </div>, document.getElementById("example"));

- Passing properties to a React component. Example:

    <script type="text/babel">
      var UnsolvedMystery = React.createClass({
        render: function() {
          return (
            <div>
              <h1>{this.props.title}</h1>
              <h2>{this.props.summary}</h2>
            </div>
          );
        }
      });
  
      ReactDOM.render(
        <UnsolvedMystery
          title="Lucy Loo Hoo"
          summary="Mysterious things happening"
        />,
        document.getElementById("example")
      );
